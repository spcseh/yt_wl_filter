## Some annoying things

- Some times if you have more videos in your watch later list, like above 500 or so, then the dynamic loading of the youtube maybe dalayed, in that case you will see first bactch of filtered videos, followed by other channel videos, to overcome this, just click on the filter button again and again in maybe a 5 second intervals, so that you get the filtered videos.
- Sorry for this little inconvenience.

Enjoy a cleaner Watch Later experience! ðŸš€
